<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hey there! My name is Joseph, and I'm learning to become a web developer.
    I am currently taking the "Becomong a Full-Stack Web Developer course" by
    Dr. Angela Yu. The course is great so far and every module gets relativley
    harder. I enjoy the challenges and being able to test myself to see my true capabilites.
  </p>

  <p>I am currently a Computer Information Systems major at Texas State University.
    I am a oncoming junior and I have small prior knowledge of codinng. I used to code
    programs in Python while I was at my community college, HCC, in Houston. The only reason
    I switched my major from Computer Science, was because, when I transferred to TXST, the primary
    coding language was C++, and I had no knowledge of thagt language. But I feel that now,
    I trust my self-teaching abilities enough to teach my self web-development.
