    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
        <h3>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</h3>
            <p>Michael Bay truly made the vision for this movie come to life.
                There is'nt a dull moment in any of the acting or cinematography. 
                Truly a work of art. The CGI has the perfect balance of realism 
                and fictionalization, whihc makes the movie a great watch.</p>
        <h3>Baby Driver</h3>
            <p>This a great movie as well. There is a perfect mix of comdey
                and action. I feel the charecter development was perfect, and 
                the actor selection was great!</p>
        <h3>Snowfall</h3>
            <p>Now I know this isnt a film , but this show truly goes underappreciated.
                Everything about this show was excellent. The acitng, the plot, the
                cinematography, and all of the above. There was never a moment where I knew
                what was coming next and that's what made the show so captivating.
